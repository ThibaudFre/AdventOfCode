Has a Junior develloper I am improving my solving problem skills. 
I know that the better way to code is to code as simple and readable.

But for now I am training for technicals tests and during them I will not have the time to think how about to  code as cleaner and simple during the short time given.

so I apollogies if my code is the not the cleanest, understandest or readble.

I swear I will not work like that.
